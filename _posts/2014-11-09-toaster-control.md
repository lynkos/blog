> Daedalus Corp. uses a [_web interface_](http://web2014.picoctf.com/toaster-control-1040194) to control some of their toaster bots. It looks like they removed the command '_Shutdown & Turn Off_' from the control panel. Maybe the functionality is still there... 

When opening the link and clicking on one of the buttons, I noticed how the page's URL looked like.

For example, clicking on 'Blink Lights', the URL would be `http://web2014.picoctf.com/toaster-control-1040194/handler.php?action=Blink Lights`

When clicking on 'Patrol Mode', the URL would be `http://web2014.picoctf.com/toaster-control-1040194/handler.php?action=Patrol Mode`

When clicking on 'Make Toast', the URL would be `http://web2014.picoctf.com/toaster-control-1040194/handler.php?action=Make Toast`

There is a pattern in that each of the URLs start with `http://web2014.picoctf.com/toaster-control-1040194/handler.php?action=`, and would end with the name of the button you were clicking.

So, since I wanted to activate the 'Shutdown & Turn Off' Command, you'd assume that the link would be `http://web2014.picoctf.com/toaster-control-1040194/handler.php?action=Shutdown & Turn Off`

But that would only bring me to this page:

But then how would I be able to go to the page? URL encoding, that's how. The problem actually lies in the ampersand ('&'), since it's not a URL-safe character. So by converting `Shutdown & Turn Off` to a URL-safe string, I'd be able to view the page.

I Google'd 'text to url' and found several text to URL converters. I used [QuickEncoder](http://quick-encoder.com/url), and pasted `Shutdown & Turn Off` into the box, then pressed 'Encode'

I copied the URL-safe string (`Shutdown+%26+Turn+Off`) and pasted it into the base URL (`http://web2014.picoctf.com/toaster-control-1040194/handler.php?action=`) so that it looked like `http://web2014.picoctf.com/toaster-control-1040194/handler.php?action=Shutdown+%26+Turn+Off`

I pressed '<kbd>Enter</kbd>' and the following page appeared:

The shutdown code, and flag, is blatantly displayed as `flag_c49bdkeekr5zqgvc20vc`
