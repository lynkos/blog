The only thing needed is an apk decompiler and some programming knowledge.

I used [decompileandroid](http://www.decompileandroid.com) to decompile the .apk package (after downloading it).

When the decompiling was complete, I downloaded the full contents of the APK.

I opened up the folder after it was downloaded (it was named 'source'), and, quite primitively, I know, searched through each subfolder, opening each and every file within it. Needless to say, the flag was located within one of the .java files in the 'picoapp' folder.

Its path is: `source → src → picoapp453 → picoctf → com → picoapp`

When I opened `ToasterActivity.java`{: .filepath}, the flag immediately popped out at me.

The String created out of a char array in the `ToasterActivity()` constructor had '`flag`' as its first four chars.

Being the lazy person I am, rather than manually remove all the commas, spaces, and apostrophes, I quickly wrote a simple Java program to do that for me because, you know, #yolo

![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgjOL5AK3p8UMHBepHltUysrwS_yMjeFNY0iqus9nvItdz6D1QsuQ1nbn0suqveRl3dfW8f7NLlqYM_Qv6qlcklni15YDAvEGiWliCMWE_cGEZBF1aRnnn-cZabjXWfb176oIUwWQ8vGws/s1600/Screen+Shot+2014-11-10+at+8.02.20+PM.png)

However, there is a simpler way of printing out the flag: println'ing (printing) the variable containing the flag. The program is here:

```java
 public class printFlag {  
      public static void main(String[] args) {  
           String entireFlag = new String(new char[] {'f', 'l', 'a', 'g', ' ',  
                     'i', 's', ':', ' ', 'w', 'h', 'a', 't',  
                     '_', 'd', 'o', 'e', 's', '_', 't', 'h',  
                     'e', '_', 'l', 'o', 'g', 'c', 'a', 't',  
                     '_', 's', 'a', 'y'});  
           System.out.println(entireFlag);  
      }
 }  
```
{: .nolineno }

And, for your convenience, the Java program I'd initially written is also here:

```java
 public class RemoveNonAlphaChars {  
      public static void main(String[] args) {  
           String entireFlag = ""  
                     + "'f', 'l', 'a', 'g', ' ', 'i', 's', ':', ' '"  
                     + ", "  
                     + "'w', "  
       + "'h', 'a', 't', '_', 'd', 'o', 'e', 's', '_', 't', "  
       + "'h', 'e',"  
       + "'_', 'l', 'o', 'g', 'c', 'a', 't', '_', "  
       + "'s', 'a', 'y'";  
           String noApos = entireFlag.replaceAll("'", "");  
           String noCom = noApos.replaceAll(",", "");  
           String flag = noCom.substring(noCom.indexOf(":") + 1, noCom.length());  
           String noSpace = flag.replaceAll(" ", "");  
           System.out.println(noSpace);  
      }  
 }  
```
{: .nolineno }

Regardless of the method used, the flag is `what_does_the_logcat_say`
