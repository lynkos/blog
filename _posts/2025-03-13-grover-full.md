## Oracle
Oracle $U_{w}$ flips the sign(s) of $n$-qubit target state(s) while leaving all other orthogonal states unchanged.

$U_{w} = X(MCZ)X$

Pauli-X gate $X$ is applied to qubit $\ket{q_{i}}$ if $q_{i} = 0$ in target state $\ket{q_{n - 1}, \ldots, q_{0}}$. After $X$ is applied to the appropriate qubit(s), target state is transformed to $\ket{1}^{\otimes n}$. Then $(n − 1)$-control Z gate $MCZ$ flips the sign of $\ket{1}^{\otimes n}$.

We simulate $MCZ$ by applying Hadamard gate $H$, $(n - 1)$-control Toffoli gate $MCT$, and another $H$ to qubit $\ket{q_{n - 1}}$

$MCZ = H(MCT)H$

Finally, $X$ is applied again to the appropriate qubit(s) to reverse the transformation by the first $X$. This entire process is applied to all target state(s), which we've implemented in `oracle()`:

$U_{w} = XH(MCT)HX$

## Diffuser
Diffuser $D$ amplifies the target state(s) (which deamplifies all other states) with a reflection about the average amplitude. In other words, it increases the probability of getting the $n$-qubit target state(s) marked by $U_{w}$ and, ultimately, the right answer.

$D = H^{\otimes n}U_{0}H^{\otimes n}$

We create $D$ by applying $H^{\otimes n}$, $U_{w}$ with its target state $w$ set to $\ket{0}^{\otimes n}$, and $H^{\otimes n}$ again to each qubit. This leaves us with the final equation we've implemented in `diffuser()`:

```py
def diffuser(name: str = "Diffuser") -> QuantumCircuit:
    """Amplify target state(s) amplitude, which decreases the amplitudes of other states and increases the probability of getting the correct solution (i.e. target state(s)).

    Args:
        name (str, optional): Quantum circuit's name. Defaults to "Diffuser".

    Returns:
        QuantumCircuit: Quantum circuit representation of diffuser (i.e. Grover's diffusion operator).
    """
    # Create N-qubit quantum circuit for diffuser
    diffuser = QuantumCircuit(QUBITS, name = name)
    
    # Hadamard gate
    diffuser.h(QUBITS)

    # Oracle with all zero target state
    diffuser.append(oracle({ "0" * N }), list(range(N)))

    # Hadamard gate
    diffuser.h(QUBITS)
    
    return diffuser

# Generate and display diffuser
grover_diffuser = diffuser()
grover_diffuser.draw("mpl", style = "iqp")
```

## Grover's Algorithm
Grover's algorithm, also known as quantum search algorithm, finds $m$ target(s) within a database of size $N$; this is particularly useful for unstructured searches. A search is performed by evaluating a function (i.e. $U_{w}$) that returns a particular value for the target(s) and another value for all other objects in the database. More generally, it solves the problem of function inversion: Given $y = f(x)$ where $x$ can take $N$ values, Grover's algorithm finds the value $x = f^{−1}(y)$ with $O(\sqrt{N})$ evaluations; a naïve exhaustive search (i.e. classical algorithm) would require about $O(N)$ evaluations. This is a significant, quadratric speed-up!

$m, N \in \mathbb{Z^{+}}$

The first step of the algorithm involves encoding all objects of the database as orthogonal states. That is, initializing all $n$ qubits to $\ket{0}$. Assuming maximum uncertainty about the $n$-qubit target state(s), the initial state is chosen to be the uniform superposition $\ket{s}$ of all basis states:

$\ket{s} = (H \ket{0})^{\otimes n}$

We do this by applying $H$ on all qubits. Afterwards, we increase the likelihood of detecting the target state(s) at the end by applying $U_{w}$ followed by $D$ (also known as Grover operator) to $\ket{s}$ an optimal amount of times $t$. After $t$ iterations, the state(s) will have transformed to $\ket{\psi_{t}}$:

$\ket{\psi_{t}} = (DU_{w})^{t} \ket{s}$

Where:

$t \in \mathbb{Z^{+}}$

$t \approx \lfloor \frac{\pi}{4} \sqrt{\frac{N}{m}}\rfloor$

In this case, $N = 2^{n}$, so $t$ can be simplified:

$t \approx \lfloor \frac{\pi}{4} \sqrt{\frac{2^{n}}{m}}\rfloor$

The final step involves measuring $\ket{\psi_{t}}$, which should return the target state(s) with near-certainty (i.e. probability very close to $1$).

Here we simulate Grover's algorithm using the `AerSimulator` backend, which is a local simulator that can simulate quantum circuits with noise. We transpile the circuit to optimize it for the backend, then run the simulation with a specified number of shots. We then get the results of the simulation and display the top measurement(s) (state(s) with the highest frequency) and target state(s) in binary and decimal form. We determine if the top measurement(s) equals the target state(s) and print the result.

```py
from heapq import nlargest
from qiskit import transpile
from qiskit_aer import AerSimulator

# Simulate Grover's algorithm locally
backend = AerSimulator(method = "density_matrix")

# Transpile circuit
transpiled = transpile(grover_circuit, backend, optimization_level = OPTIMIZATION_LEVEL)

# Display transpiled circuit
transpiled.draw("mpl", style = "iqp")

# Run simulation 
simulation = backend.run(transpiled, shots = SHOTS)

# Get results
results = simulation.result().get_counts()

# State(s) with highest count and their frequencies
winners = { winner : results.get(winner) for winner in nlargest(len(TARGETS), results, key = results.get) } # type: ignore

def outcome(winners: list[str], counts) -> None:
    """Print top measurement(s) (state(s) with highest frequency)

    if top measurement(s) equals target state(s), then print result.

    Args:

        counts (Counts): Each state and its respective frequency.
    """
    print("WINNER(S):")
    print(f"Binary = {winners}\nDecimal = {[ int(key, 2) for key in winners ]}\n")
        
    print("TARGET(S):")
    print(f"Binary = {TARGETS}\nDecimal = {SEARCH_VALUES}\n")

    if not all(key in TARGETS for key in winners): print ("Target(s) not found...")

    else:
        winners_frequency, total = 0, 0

        for value, frequency in counts.items():
            if value in winners:
                winners_frequency += frequency
            total += frequency
        
        print(f"Target(s) found with {winners_frequency / total:.2%} accuracy!")

# Print outcome
outcome(list(winners.keys()), results)
```

```
WINNER(S):
Binary = ['0011', '1001', '0000']
Decimal = [3, 9, 0]

TARGET(S):
Binary = {'0000', '0011', '1001'}
Decimal = {0, 9, 3}

Target(s) found with 94.99% accuracy!
```

Finally, we display the simulation results as a histogram. The histogram shows the frequency of each state measured during the simulation. The state(s) with the highest frequency are the winner(s) and should equal the target state(s).

```py
from qiskit.visualization import plot_histogram

# Display simulation results as histogram
plot_histogram(data = results, legend = ["Qubits"], number_to_keep = len(TARGETS), title = TITLE)
```

## Density Matrix
Density matrix is a collection of numbers in a matrix used to describe $n$-qubit state(s) in a system. In our case, `density_matrix` represents $m$ winner(s) (which should equal our target state(s)), and is visualized in the diagrams below.

### City Plot
City plot is made up of two 3D bar graphs representing the real and imaginary parts of an $n$-qubit state. Each bar's length is proportional to the magnitude of the corresponding number.

```py
# City plot of density_matrix
density_matrix.draw("city")
```

### Bloch Sphere
Bloch sphere is a 3D geometric representation of a single qubit's state. A point $(\theta, \phi)$ on the sphere's surface denotes a pure state, represented by state vector $\ket{\psi}$, with its north and south poles corresponding to $\ket{0}$ and $\ket{1}$ respectively. This means that we can always say for certain (100% probability) that our system's in state $\ket{\psi}$. In other words, for a pure state we have complete knowledge of the system and know exactly what state it's in.

$\ket{\psi} = \alpha \ket{0} + \beta \ket{1}$

Probability amplitudes $\alpha$ and $\beta$ can be real or complex numbers.

$\alpha = cos(\frac{\theta}{2})$

$\beta = e^{i \phi} sin(\frac{\theta}{2})$

$\theta, \phi \in \mathbb{R}$ where $0 \le \theta \le \pi$ and $0 \le \phi \le 2\pi$.

The probability of obtaining $\ket{0}$ and $\ket{1}$ after measurement is $\vert \alpha \vert^{2}$ and $\vert \beta \vert^{2}$ respectively, hence the total probability of the system being observed in $\ket{0}$ or $\ket{1}$ is $1$:

$\vert \alpha \vert^{2} + \vert \beta \vert^{2} = 1$

A point inside the sphere denotes a mixed state, represented by density matrix $\hat{\rho}$, which is a probability distribution of different pure states, with a maximally mixed state at the sphere's center (equal probabilities of being observed in $\ket{0}$ or $\ket{1}$). $\hat{\rho}$ is a generalized version of a state vector and is used to represent the system when we're uncertain of its state.

$\hat{\rho} = \sum\limits_{k}^{N} p_{k} \ket{\psi_{k}} \bra{\psi_{k}} =
\displaystyle\frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix}1 + r_{z} & r_{x} - ir_{y} \\ r_{x} + ir_{y} & 1 - r_{z}\end{bmatrix}$

Weights $p_{k}$ can be interpreted as the probability of the system being in state $\ket{\psi_{k}}$ where $0 \lt p_{k} \le 1$. Note: $\hat{\rho}$ of a pure state naturally reduces to $\ket{\psi}$ with $p = 1$.

$N$ is the total number of possible states the system could be in with $\sum\limits_{k}^{N} p_{k} = 1$.

$\ket{\psi_{k}} \bra{\psi_{k}}$ represents the outer product of the state $ket{\psi_{k}}$ with itself, producing a matrix known as the projection operator $\hat{P_{\psi_{k}}}$.

Coefficients $r_{x}, r_{y}, r_{z}$ are components of the vector representing a mixed state, known as the Bloch vector $\vec{r}$.

# Bloch sphere representation of density_matrix
# reverse_bits = True since Qiskit uses little-endian for qubit ordering

### Hinton Plot
Hinton plot represents the real and imaginary parts of $n$-qubit state(s) on 2D plots by using squares. Positive and negative values are represented by white and black squares respectively, and the size of each square represents the magnitude of each value.

```py
# Hinton plot of density_matrix
density_matrix.draw("hinton")
```

![Hinton plot of density matrix](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lynkos/grovers-algorithm/main/assets/figures/hinton.png)

### Q-Sphere
Q-Sphere is a visualization of $n$-qubit state(s) that associates each computational basis state with a point on the surface of a sphere. A node is visible at each point; each node's radius is proportional to the probability $p_{k}$ of its basis state, whereas the node color indicates its phase $\varphi_{k}$. The sphere's north and south poles correspond to basis states $\ket{0}^{\otimes n}$ and $\ket{1}^{\otimes n}$ respectively, with all other basis states in between. Beginning at the north pole and progressing southward, each successive latitude has basis states with a greater number of $1$'s; a basis state's latitude is determined by its Hamming distance from $\ket{0}^{\otimes n}$. The vector(s) on the sphere represents the system's density matrix.

```py
# Qsphere representation of density_matrix
density_matrix.draw("qsphere")
```
