With a little bit of tinkering, it's possible to run both macOS (i.e. native) AND Windows games on a MacBook Pro (M3 Max, in my case). Playable Windows games include Skyrim, Mass Effect series, Palworld, Schedule I, and many more!

**Demo / Examples**

This entire process can be quite daunting and confusing, and it is assumed that the reader:
- Has good terminal commands skills and is comfortable with using terminal/CLI
- Understands Wine concepts (e.g. `WINEPREFIX`, dll overrides, etc.)
- Knows how to launch Windows executables through Wine from terminal

{: .prompt-important }

## Background
Key concepts that will continue to show up throughout this writeup:

- Wine
- Bottles aka Wine Prefixes (`$WINEPREFIX`)
- Wine builds
- Graphics APIs (i.e. D3DMetal, DXMT, DXVK, etc.)

### Bottles
I store my Wine prefixes, i.e. bottles, in `$HOME/Bottles`. Each bottle is virtual Windows environment (e.g. Windows 10) with its own C: drive and all its standard folders (e.g. Windows and Program Files), as well as:
- Windows registry
- System settings
- One or more Windows applications/software
- Saved user data
- Fonts
- And more

You can install multiple programs into a bottle, but it's sometimes better to create a new bottle for each application. Keeping applications in separate bottles prevents them from interacting with or damaging each other. E.g. You can test out a new version of a particular program in one bottle while keeping the original in another. Multiple bottles are also helpful whenever a specific application requires otherwise undesirable settings.

The default Wine bottle, `.wine`, is located in your home directory (i.e. `$HOME/.wine`). However, I never use the default Wine bottle/prefix since I always use a specific Wine prefix (i.e. `$WINEPREFIX`).

I've specifically made bottles for each Graphics API: `DXMT`, `DXVK`, `GPTk`, and `CrossOver` (note: I only use the 1st 3 bottles, i.e. I *don't* use CrossOver for gaming).

### Builds
`wine` command loads and runs the given program, which can be a DOS, Windows 3.x, Win32, or Win64 executable (on 64-bit systems).[^wine]

> Wine is **not isolated** from your system: if _you_ can access a file or resource with your user account, programs running in Wine _can too_—see [#Running Wine under a separate user account](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Wine#Running_Wine_under_a_separate_user_account) for possible precautions
> 
> Wine can also run malware—see [Wine FAQ on Malware compatibility](https://gitlab.winehq.org/wine/wine/-/wikis/FAQ#is-wine-malware-compatible)
{: .prompt-warning }

The program name may be specified in DOS format (e.g. `C:\\WINDOWS\\SOL.EXE`{: .filepath}) or in Unix format (e.g. `/msdos/windows/sol.exe`{: .filepath}). You may pass arguments to the program being executed by adding them to the end of the command line invoking `wine`. E.g.

```sh
wine notepad "C:\\Temp\\README.txt"
wine notepad 'C:\Temp\README.txt'
wine notepad "$HOME/Temp/README.txt"
```
{: .nolineno }

It can also be one of the Windows executables shipped with Wine, in which case specifying the full path is not mandatory, e.g. `wine explorer` or `wine notepad`.

I store all my different versions of Wine (i.e. builds) in `$HOME/Wine`.

### Files
Basic Wine files[^winefiles]

<ul>
	<li><code>wine</code>: Wine program loader</li>
	<li><code>wineconsole</code>: Wine program loader for CUI (console) applications</li>
	<li><code>wineserver</code>: Wine server</li>
	<li><code>winedbg</code>: Wine debugger</li>
	<li><code>$WINEPREFIX/dosdevices</code>: Directory containing the DOS device mappings. Each file in that directory is a symlink to the Unix device file implementing a given device. E.g. if <code>COM1</code> is mapped to <code>/dev/ttyS0</code> you'd have a symlink of the form <code>$WINEPREFIX/dosdevices/com1</code> -> <code>/dev/ttyS0</code>.<br>DOS drives are also specified with symlinks; e.g. if drive <code>D:</code> corresponds to the CDROM mounted at <code>/mnt/cdrom</code>, you'd have a symlink <code>$WINEPREFIX/dosdevices/d:</code> -> <code>/mnt/cdrom</code>. The Unix device corresponding to a DOS drive can be specified the same way, except with <code>::</code> instead of <code>:</code>. So for the previous example, if the CDROM device is mounted from <code>/dev/hdc</code>, the corresponding symlink would be <code>$WINEPREFIX/dosdevices/d::</code> -> <code>/dev/hdc</code>.</li>
</ul>

## Requirements
- Apple Silicon Mac (i.e. M series)
- macOS 15 Sequoia or higher
- At least 16 GB of RAM or more (recommended since translated games require more resources)
- [Command Line Tools for Xcode 15+](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/resources) ([downloaded via the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12))
-  [Game Porting Toolkit](https://developer.apple.com/downloads?q=porting%20toolkit) (from [Apple Developers](https://developer.apple.com/games/game-porting-toolkit))
- [Steam (Windows Version)](https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/client/installer/SteamSetup.exe)
- **Optional** Game Controller

## Setup
Go to <a target="_blank" title="Link to Apple's Game Porting Toolkit site" href="https://developer.apple.com/games/game-porting-toolkit">the official page for Game Porting Toolkit</a>, scroll down to "**Evaluate your Windows executable on Apple silicon**", and click **Download the evaluation environment for Windows games**

![gptk.png](../assets/obsidian/gptk.png)

> You can also download Game Porting Toolkit in its entirety since it includes the evaluation environment, but it'll also include a bunch of stuff that you most likely won't use, such as example code, human interface guidelines, etc.
{: .prompt-info }

You'll be prompted to sign into your Apple account and create an Apple Developer account if you don't have one already (don't worry, it's free)

![apple_sign_in.png](../assets/obsidian/apple_sign_in.png)

Once redirected to the downloads page, click **Evaluation environment for Windows games 2.1.dmg** to download the evaluation environment

![download_gptk.png](../assets/obsidian/download_gptk.png)


Double-click the `.dmg` after it's downloaded to open/mount it

![gptk_downloads.png](../assets/obsidian/gptk_downloads.png)

Click **Agree** to the license agreement

![license_agreement.png](../assets/obsidian/license_agreement.png)

Once mounted, it'll open a window that should look similar to this

![eval_env.png](../assets/obsidian/eval_env.png)

You should also be able to see it in "Finder"

![eval_env2.png](../assets/obsidian/eval_env2.png)

Download <a target="_blank" title="Link to Xcode on Apple Developer site" href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/resources">Command Line Tools for Xcode</a>, which you will need to <a target="_blank" title="Link to Xcode in the App Store" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12">download via the App Store</a>

![app_store.png](../assets/obsidian/app_store.png)

Run the `.pkg` file
	- **Manually**: Double-click the `.pkg` file
	- Via command line (where `PKG_PATH` is the path to the `.pkg` file): `installer -pkg PKG_PATH -target <target_path>`

Open your terminal, then install Rosetta

```sh
softwareupdate --install-rosetta
```
{: .nolineno }

> If you want to automatically agree to license, add `--agree-to-license` to command
> ```sh
> softwareupdate --install-rosetta --agree-to-license
> ```
> {: .nolineno }
{: .prompt-tip }

![iterm.png](../assets/obsidian/iterm.png)

Enter x86_64 shell; all subsequent commands **must** be run in this shell

```sh
arch -x86_64 /bin/bash
```
{: .nolineno }

![x86_iterm.png](../assets/obsidian/x86_iterm.png)

Install x86 version of Homebrew

```sh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```
{: .nolineno }

![homebrew_iterm.png](../assets/obsidian/homebrew_iterm.png)

Set the path, depending on the number of Homebrew versions you have

{% tabs set-brew-path %}
    ---TAB: x86 AND ARM64
        If you use **both x86 _and_ ARM64** versions of Homebrew, you can add the following to `.bashrc` (or your preferred shell config file) so it automatically switches based off architecture type
        ```sh
		if [ "$(arch)" = "arm64" ]; then
			eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
		else
			eval "$(/usr/local/bin/brew shellenv)"
			export PATH="/usr/local/bin:${PATH}"
		fi
		```
		{: file="$HOME/.bashrc" }
        {: .nolineno }
    ---TAB: x86 ONLY
        If you **only have x86** version of Homebrew (which was installed in the previous step), execute this command to append the path (`eval "$(/usr/local/bin/brew shellenv)"`) to `.bash_profile`
		```sh
		(echo; echo 'eval "$(/usr/local/bin/brew shellenv)"') >> $HOME/.bash_profile
		eval "$(/usr/local/bin/brew shellenv)"
		```
        {: .nolineno }
        ![eval_iterm.png](../assets/obsidian/eval_iterm.png)
{% endtabs %}

Since your shell config file has been updated, restart the terminal and return to x86_64 shell

```sh
arch -x86_64 /bin/bash
```
{: .nolineno }

Confirm path

```sh
which brew
```
{: .nolineno }

![which_brew_iterm.png](../assets/obsidian/which_brew_iterm.png)

> Update `PATH` environment variable (in your shell config file) if the previous command doesn't print `/usr/local/bin/brew`{: .filepath}; alternatively, you can fully specify the path to brew in the subsequent commands
{: .prompt-info }

## Installation
I have different versions of Wine on my system which I use for different purposes.
- **Game Porting Toolkit.app**: This is a translation layer that combines Wine with D3DMetal (which supports DirectX 11 and 12). I use this if I want to use D3DMetal graphics API. Only downside is that this build uses an old version of Wine (7.7), so there are some bugs (e.g. window sizing, unable to download games, etc.). Don't use it to install Steam games.
- **Wine Devel.app**: I use this if I want to use DXMT or DXVK graphics API. This build uses a recent version of Wine (10.14).
- **CrossOver.app**: I don't use this, but it contains some useful files that I can use with other Wine builds. See [Install CrossOver](2025-03-19-play-windows-games.md#install-crossover) for more details.

| Prefix                    | Build Name       | Wine Version | Graphics API(s)                | Description                   |
| :------------------------ | :--------------- | :----------- | :----------------------------- | :---------------------------- |
| `$HOME/Bottles/GPTk`      | gptk/3.0b2       | 7.7          | D3DMetal                       | Game Porting Toolkit 3 Beta 2 |
| `$HOME/Bottles/DXMT`      | dxmt/10.12       | 10.14        | DXMT                           | DirectX to Metal              |
| `$HOME/Bottles/DXVK`      | dxvk/10.12       | 10.14        | DXVK                           | DirectX to Vulkan             |
| `$HOME/Bottles/CrossOver` | crossover/23.7.1 | 8.0.1        | D3DMetal, DXMT, DXVK, MoltenVK | CrossOver by CodeWeavers      |

Since we'll be working with several different Wine builds, we should create a directory containing each of these Wine builds to keep it organized.

```sh
mkdir -p $HOME/Wine && cd $HOME/Wine
mkdir dxmt dxvk gptk crossover
```
{: .nolineno }

Your `$HOME` directory should now look similar to this (where `...` denotes all other directories and files, which are currently irrelevant for this tutorial)

```plaintext
$HOME/ 
├── ... 
├── Bottles/ 
│   ├── DXMT/
│   ├── DXVK/
│   ├── GPTk/
│   └── CrossOver/
├── ...
└── Wine/
    ├── dxmt/
    ├── dxvk/
    ├── gptk/
    └── crossover/
```
{: file="$HOME" }

> Ensure you're in an x86_64 shell. If not, run:
> ```sh
> arch -x86_64 /bin/bash
> ```
> {: .nolineno }
{: .prompt-info }

To set version of Wine depending on type, add to `PATH`. This way, `which wine` outputs `$HOME/Wine/10.12/bin/wine`. E.g.

```sh
export PATH="$HOME/Wine/DXMT/bin:$PATH"
```
{: .nolineno }

Create a new Wine prefix; e.g. if you have bottle `$HOME/Games`, set `WINEPREFIX` like so:

```sh
WINEPREFIX="$HOME/Games" wine winecfg
```
{: .nolineno }

Once a "Wine configuration" shows up, change the version to **Windows 10**, then click **Apply** and **OK** to save and exit

![winecfg.png](../assets/obsidian/winecfg.png)

> If the "Wine configuration" window does not appear and no new icon appears in the Dock, make sure you've correctly installed:
> - `x86_64` version of Homebrew
> - `game-porting-toolkit` formula
{: .prompt-tip }

### Install Game Porting Toolkit
Apple's Game Porting Toolkit (GPTk) is a translation layer that combines a patched version of an old version of Wine with D3DMetal (which supports DirectX 11 and 12).

> Make sure that GPTk's `.dmg` (downloaded from Apple's website) is already mounted; it should be located in `/Volumes` directory
> ![volumes.png](../assets/obsidian/volumes.png)
{: .prompt-info }

Path: `/Applications/Game Porting Toolkit.app/Contents/Resources/wine/bin/wine64`{: .filepath}

Create symlink in Wine dir for GPTk that points to homebrew-installed GPTk cask

```sh
ln -sf "/Applications/Game Porting Toolkit.app/Contents/Resources/wine" "$HOME/Wine/3.0b2-gptk"
```
{: .nolineno }

While the Homebrew-wine and Apple's GPTK lib is in `/Applications/Game\ Porting\ Toolkit.app/Contents/Resources/wine/lib/external/`

#### Version 3.0
 Install Dean Greer's `game-porting-toolkit` via `x86` version of Homebrew (`/usr/local/bin/brew`{: .filepath})

```sh
brew install --cask --no-quarantine gcenx/wine/game-porting-toolkit
```
{: .nolineno }

> Early in the macOS 16 Tahoe beta period these pre-built tools may still be carrying the prior version of D3DMetal. You can temporarily update these tools to use the latest version as follows.
{: .prompt-info }

Enter GPTk's library directory

```sh
cd /Applications/Game\ Porting\ Toolkit.app/Contents/Resources/wine/lib
```
{: .nolineno }

Rename current libraries (to keep a copy)

`-v3b2` suffix denotes that the copy's version is from GPTk 3.0

```sh
mv external external-v3
```
{: .nolineno }

Move `external` from drive to directory

```sh
mv "/Volumes/Evaluation environment for Windows games 3.0 beta 3/redist/lib/external" "/Applications/Game Porting Toolkit.app/Contents/Resources/wine/lib/external"
```
{: .nolineno }

`nvngx-on-metalfx.so`{: .filepath} alias missing in wine (old); only see `nvngx.so`{: .filepath}

```sh
mv wine wine-old
```
{: .nolineno }

```sh
/bin/ls "/Volumes/Evaluation environment for Windows games 3.0 beta 3/redist/lib/wine/x86_64-unix"
```
{: .nolineno }

```plaintext
atidxx64.so         d3d11.so            dxgi.so             nvngx-on-metalfx.so
d3d10.so            d3d12.so            nvapi64.so
```

```sh
/bin/ls "/Volumes/Evaluation environment for Windows games 3.0 beta 3/redist/lib/wine/x86_64-windows"
```
{: .nolineno }

```plaintext
atidxx64.dll         d3d12.dll            nvngx-on-metalfx.dll
d3d10.dll            dxgi.dll
d3d11.dll            nvapi64.dll
```

Update GPTk's library directory with new library from `.dmg` 

```sh
ditto "/Volumes/Evaluation environment for Windows games 3.0 beta 3/redist/lib/" .
```
{: .nolineno }

To enable experimental MetalFX integration, perform the following steps:
- Rename `wine/x86_64-unix/nvngx-on-metalfx.so`{: .filepath} to `wine/x86_64-unix/nvngx.so`{: .filepath} (if this hasn’t already been done) **DONE**
- Rename `wine/x86_64-windows/nvngx-on-metalfx.dll`{: .filepath} to `wine/x86_64-windows/nvngx.dll`{: .filepath} (if this hasn’t already been done) **DONE**
- Copy both `nvngx.dll`{: .filepath} and `nvapi64.dll`{: .filepath} to the `windows\system32` directory your Wine prefix’s virtual C: drive (open `$WINEPREFIX/drive_c/windows/system32`). Rename old versions in `system32` to `nvngx_orig.dll`{: .filepath} and `nvapi64_orig.dll`{: .filepath} **DONE**

#### Version 2.1 (OUTDATED)
Download Apple tap

```sh
brew tap apple/apple http://github.com/apple/homebrew-apple
```
{: .nolineno }

Install the `game-porting-toolkit` formula

```sh
brew install apple/apple/game-porting-toolkit
```
{: .nolineno }

> If during installation you see an error such as “Error: game-porting-toolkit: unknown or unsupported macOS version: :dunno”, your version of Homebrew doesn’t have macOS Sonoma support. Update to the latest version of Homebrew and try again.
> ```sh
> brew update ; brew install apple/apple/game-porting-toolkit
> ```
> {: .nolineno }
{: .prompt-tip }

Copy the Game Porting Toolkit library directory into Wine’s library directory

```sh
ditto /Volumes/Evaluation\ environment\ for\ Windows\ games\ 2.1/redist/lib/ $(brew --prefix game-porting-toolkit)/lib/
```
{: .nolineno }

Put the 3 scripts from the Game Porting Toolkit DMG into `/usr/local/bin`

```sh
cp /Volumes/Evaluation\ environment\ for\ Windows\ games\ 2.1/gameportingtoolkit* /usr/local/bin
```
{: .nolineno }

### Install Wine
This version of Wine can be used with DXMT and DXVK.

[Download the latest macOS Wine build](https://github.com/Gcenx/macOS_Wine_builds/releases)

Extract compressed download (v10.14 is named `wine-devel-10.14-osx64.tar.xz`{: .filepath})

```sh
tar -xvzf $HOME/Downloads/wine-devel-10.14-osx64.tar.xz
```
{: .nolineno }

Copy the `wine` directory into DXMT and DXVK

```sh
cp -r "$HOME/Downloads/Wine Devel.app/Contents/Resources/wine" "$HOME/Wine/dxmt"
cp -r "$HOME/Downloads/Wine Devel.app/Contents/Resources/wine" "$HOME/Wine/dxvk"
```
{: .nolineno }

Rename `wine` to its version number (aka [release version of macOS Wine builds](https://github.com/Gcenx/macOS_Wine_builds/releases)), which is `10.14` in this case

```sh
mv "$HOME/Wine/dxmt/wine" "$HOME/Wine/dxmt/10.14"
mv "$HOME/Wine/dxvk/wine" "$HOME/Wine/dxvk/10.14"
```
{: .nolineno }

Continue to [Install DXMT](2025-03-19-play-windows-games.md#install-dxmt) and [Install DXVK](2025-03-19-play-windows-games.md#install-dxvk), since we will need our Wine build(s) for those steps

// TODO: Instead of creating separate Wine copies for each graphics API, why not just use the same Wine build with all graphics API files (dlls, so, etc.), e.g. `winemetal_dxmt.dll`{: .filepath} vs `winemetal_dxvk.dll`{: .filepath}, `winemetal_orig.dll`{: .filepath}, etc. When setting a specific build (e.g. DXMT, DXVK, etc.), the relevant file(s) will be renamed (e.g. current `winemetal.dll`{: .filepath} is renamed to `winemetal_xyz.dll`{: .filepath}, then `winemetal_dxmt.dll`{: .filepath} is renamed to `winemetal.dll`{: .filepath} in order to enable DXMT).

#### Install DXMT
> Make sure to download Wine before continuing; see [Install Wine](2025-03-19-play-windows-games.md#install-wine) for instructions.
{: .prompt-important }

[DXMT](https://github.com/3Shain/dxmt) is a Metal-based translation layer for Direct3D 11 (`d3d11`) and Direct3D 10 (`d3d10`), which allows running 3D applications on macOS using Wine.

> If you want to build DXMT yourself, skip steps 1 – 4 and refer to the ["Build" section in DXMT repository's `README.md`](https://github.com/3Shain/dxmt?tab=readme-ov-file#build).
> 
> Refer to [DXMT installer](2025-03-19-play-windows-games.md#dxmt-installer) for a Bash script to automatically install DXMT into your Wine build.
{: .prompt-tip }

Go to [DXMT repository's releases](https://github.com/3Shain/dxmt/releases)

Find the most recent release (which, as of this writing, is [Version 0.61](https://github.com/3Shain/dxmt/releases/tag/v0.61))

Under **Assets**, download the attached GitHub Actions artifact (built with `-Dwine_builtin_dll=true`) named similarly to `dxmt-v0.60-builtin.tar.gz`{: .filepath} (do not download the Source code!)

Unzip the downloaded artifact by double-clicking it or running the following command (change path/filename if needed)

```sh
tar -xvzf $HOME/Downloads/dxmt-v0.60-builtin.tar.gz
```
{: .nolineno }

You should now have a directory containing `i386-windows`, `x86_64-unix`, and `x86_64-windows` subdirectories, each of which contains various files

Before proceeding, make sure you have the right path of the libraries for the version of Wine you're using! We'll set that path to environment variable `WINELIB` to make the following commands easier to follow; be sure to change the actual path if needed. If correctly set, the commands `echo $WINELIB` and `echo $DXMT_PATH` should print their respective specified path.

```sh
export WINEPATH="$HOME/Wine/dxmt/10.14"
export WINELIB="$WINEPATH/lib/wine"
export DXMT_PATH="$HOME/Downloads/v0.61"
export WINEPREFIX="$HOME/Bottles/DXMT"
```
{: .nolineno }

Move `$DXMT_PATH/x86_64-unix/winemetal.so`{: .filepath} into `x86_64-unix` directory in your Wine library

```sh
mv -i $DXMT_PATH/x86_64-unix/winemetal.so $WINELIB/x86_64-unix/
```
{: .nolineno }

Copy `$DXMT_PATH/x86_64-windows/winemetal.dll`{: .filepath} into `x86_64-windows` directory in your Wine library **AND** `system32` directory in your `WINEPREFIX`

```sh
cp -i $DXMT_PATH/x86_64-windows/winemetal.dll $WINELIB/x86_64-windows/winemetal.dll
mv -i $DXMT_PATH/x86_64-windows/winemetal.dll $WINEPREFIX/drive_c/windows/system32/
```
{: .nolineno }

> Using `cp` (copy) command instead of `mv` (move) since `winemetal.dll`{: .filepath} will be used in 2 separate locations. `mv` requires a destination directory, while `cp` should be destination file.
{: .prompt-info }

Move `$DXMT_PATH/x86_64-windows/d3d11.dll`{: .filepath} into `x86_64-windows` directory in your Wine library
```sh
mv -i $DXMT_PATH/x86_64-windows/d3d11.dll $WINELIB/x86_64-windows/
```
{: .nolineno }

Move `$DXMT_PATH/x86_64-windows/dxgi.dll`{: .filepath} into `x86_64-windows` directory in your Wine library
```sh
mv -i $DXMT_PATH/x86_64-windows/dxgi.dll $WINELIB/x86_64-windows/

#### Install DXVK
> Make sure to download Wine before continuing; see [Install Wine](2025-03-19-play-windows-games.md#install-wine) for instructions.
{: .prompt-important }

DXVK is a Vulkan-based translation layer for Direct3D 8/9/10/11 (Linux) // Direct3D 10/11 (macOS), which allows running 3D applications with Wine.

MoltenVK doesn't provide the required Vulkan extensions to use upstream DXVK so use modified fork [DXVK-macOS](https://github.com/Gcenx/DXVK-macOS).

> DXVK/Vulkan use the following env: `export MVK_CONFIG_RESUME_LOST_DEVICE=1`
> (wine doesn't handle `VK_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST` correctly)
{: .prompt-info }

Download and unpack [the latest DXVK package for macOS](https://github.com/Gcenx/DXVK-macOS/releases)

Install the downloaded DXVK package into a given wine prefix (i.e. copy or symlink the DLLs into the following directories as follows)

```sh
export WINEPREFIX=$HOME/Bottles/DXVK
cd $HOME/Downloads/dxvk-macOS-async
mv -i x64/*.dll $WINEPREFIX/drive_c/windows/system32
mv -i x32/*.dll $WINEPREFIX/drive_c/windows/syswow64
```
{: .nolineno }

Open `winecfg` and manually add DLL overrides for `d3d11` and `d3d10core`

```sh
WINEPREFIX=$HOME/Bottles/DXVK $HOME/Wine/dxvk/10.14/bin/wine winecfg
```
{: .nolineno }

Verify that your application uses DXVK instead of wined3d by enabling the HUD

```sh
DXVK_CONFIG_FILE=$HOME/Wine/dxvk/10.14/dxvk.conf DXVK_HUD=full
```
{: .nolineno }

To remove DXVK from a prefix, remove the DLLs and DLL overrides, and run `wineboot -u` to restore the original DLL files.

There shouldn't be (i.e. I shouldn't add, b/c it didn't originally come w/) a `winemetal.dll`{: .filepath} in DXVK'S `$WINEPREFIX`

#### Install CrossOver
Install pre-built version of CrossOver v23.7.1 (Wine 8.0.1) via `x86` version of Homebrew (`/usr/local/bin/brew`{: .filepath})

```sh
brew install --cask --no-quarantine gcenx/wine/wine-crossover
```
{: .nolineno }

Create symlink

```sh
ln -s "/Applications/Wine Crossover.app/Contents/Resources/wine" "$HOME/Wine/23.7.1-crossover"
```
{: .nolineno }

This is the most compatible option, as it has all the aforementioned graphics APIs.

`WINEPREFIX=$HOME/Bottles/Test "/Applications/CrossOver.app/Contents/SharedSupport/CrossOver/CrossOver-Hosted Application/wine" winecfg`

CrossOver's game porting toolkit lib is in `/Applications/CrossOver.app/Contents/SharedSupport/CrossOver/lib64/apple_gptk/external/`

### Update MoltenVK
[Download latest MoltenVK release](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/MoltenVK/releases)

Open terminal and set variables

```sh
WINE_LIB="$HOME/Wine/dxmt/10.14/lib"
MVK_DYLIB="$HOME/Downloads/MoltenVK/MoltenVK/dylib/macOS/libMoltenVK.dylib"
```
{: .nolineno }

Backup original copy by renaming `libMoltenVK.dylib`{: .filepath} in Wine build's lib to `libMoltenVK_orig.dylib`{: .filepath}

```sh
mv -i "$WINE_LIB/libMoltenVK.dylib" "$WINE_LIB/libMoltenVK_orig.dylib"
```
{: .nolineno }

Move new MoltenVK dylib into Wine build's lib

```sh
mv -i "$MVK_DYLIB" "$WINE_LIB"
```
{: .nolineno }

### Install Steam
> Make sure the Windows version of Steam is located in your `Downloads` folder before installing
{: .prompt-info }

You can use the installer script in [Steam Installer](2025-03-19-play-windows-games.md#steam-installer), or complete the following steps.

Install the Windows version of Steam

```sh
wine "$HOME/Downloads/SteamSetup.exe"
```
{: .nolineno }

Run the Windows version of Steam to make sure it works

```sh
wine "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steam.exe"
```
{: .nolineno }

If it works, continue to [Usage](2025-03-19-play-windows-games.md#usage) section. Otherwise, follow the steps in [[#`steamwebhelper` not responding]] section before moving onto the [Usage](2025-03-19-play-windows-games.md#usage) section.

### Install Winetricks
// TODO

## Configuration
Configuring Wine is typically accomplished using:
- [control](https://gitlab.winehq.org/wine/wine/-/wikis/Commands/control) — Wine's implementation of the [Windows Control Panel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_Panel_\(Windows\) "wikipedia:Control Panel (Windows)"), which can be started by running `wine control`
- [regedit](https://gitlab.winehq.org/wine/wine/-/wikis/Commands/regedit) — Wine's [registry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Registry "wikipedia:Windows Registry") editing tool, which can be started by running `regedit`—see also [Useful Registry Keys](https://gitlab.winehq.org/wine/wine/-/wikis/Useful-Registry-Keys)
- [winecfg](https://gitlab.winehq.org/wine/wine/-/wikis/Commands/winecfg) — a [GUI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface "wikipedia:Graphical user interface") configuration tool for Wine, which can be started by running `winecfg`

See [Programs](https://gitlab.winehq.org/wine/wine/-/wikis/Commands#programs) for the full list.

## Usage
> Ensure you're in an x86_64 shell. If not, run:
> ```sh
> arch -x86_64 /bin/bash
> ```
> {: .nolineno }
{: .prompt-info }

- **Steam**: `"C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steam.exe"`{: .filepath}
- **Game**: `"C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\MyGame\MyGame.exe"`{: .filepath}

### Launch Steam
If you want to play the game via Steam. This is the basic command; it runs Steam with Wine. You can add additional environment variables. Refer to [Environment Variables](2025-03-19-play-windows-games.md#environment-variables) section for a list of compatible environment variables.
```sh
wine "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steam.exe"
```
{: .nolineno }

### Launch Directly
You can launch the game directly to avoid Steam's extra processes. This may improve performance, but you won't be able to use certain Steam features (e.g. Steam Cloud, online, etc.).

```sh
wine "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\MyGame\MyGame.exe"
```
{: .nolineno }

> Replace `MyGame` with the name of your game; if it isn't in Steam or its path is different, update the command path accordingly.
{: .prompt-info }

For example, if you want to enable e-sync and disable the Metal Performance HUD when running `MyGame.exe`.

```sh
MTL_HUD_ENABLED=0 WINEESYNC=1 wine "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\MyGame\MyGame.exe"
```
{: .nolineno }

Feel free to add and remove environment variables as you like; you're not constrained to the aforementioned ones. Refer to [Environment Variables](2025-03-19-play-windows-games.md#environment-variables) section for a list of compatible environment variables.

### Stop Running Wine
All running `wine` and `wineconsole` processes are stopped at once using the [`wineserver -k`](https://gitlab.winehq.org/wine/wine/-/wikis/Wine-User's-Guide#-k-n) command.

```sh
wineserver -k 15
```
{: .nolineno }

This command is `WINEPREFIX`-dependent, so when using a custom Wine prefix, run i.e.

```sh
WINEPREFIX="$HOME/Games" wineserver -k
```
{: .nolineno }

Alternatively, try this command:

```sh
killall -9 wineserver && killall -9 wine64-preloader
```
{: .nolineno }

#### DXMT
Rename `winemetal_i386-windows.dll` in `e` to `winemetal.dll` for 32 bit. 64 bit is default; so if switching to 32bit, rename current `winemetal.dll` to `winemetal_x86_64-windows.dll` before renaming the 32bit one.

### Troubleshooting
#### Game Porting Toolkit
This section is taken directly from different Game Porting Toolkit's `README.md` files, hence the blockquotes.

##### Game won't run and crashes with an invalid instruction or complains about lack of certain instruction extensions
> Invalid instruction crashes are sometimes caused when the Rosetta 2 instruction translation layer is unable to translate CPU instructions. You may be able to recompile a version of your game without certain instructions in order to evaluate its potential on Apple Silicon with the Game Porting Toolkit when you hit this error. You may also be able to use the `ROSETTA_ADVERTISE_AVX` environment variable to ensure your game recognizes available translation instruction extensions. When porting your code natively to Apple Silicon there are a variety or NEON and ARM instructions which offer high-performance replacements for AVX / AVX2, BMI, F16c and other less common instruction set extensions.

##### Game won't run because its anti-cheat or DRM software is incompatible with Wine translation
> You may be able to rebuild a custom version of your game in your Windows development environment with anti-cheat or DRM disabled for your own evaluation purposes. When porting your code natively to Apple Silicon and macOS, contact your anti-cheat or DRM provider—most have native Apple Silicon solutions for your native build, or you may find that existing macOS solutions like Hardened Runtime, Application Sandbox, and Application Attestation prevent forms of cheating or tampering that concern you.

##### Game won’t run because it thinks the version of Windows is too old
> First, make sure you have selected an appropriate Windows version in `winecfg`. This affects the major and minor Windows versions that are reported to your game.
>
> If your game checks for a specific minimum or an exact build version, you can alter this value by changing the `CurrentBuild` and `CurrentBuildNumber` values of the `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT` registry key. You must perform this step _after_ selecting a Windows version in `winecfg`. Run the following commands, replacing `«BUILD_NUMBER»` with the specific build number your game checks for; if you're unsure, build `19042` should work for most games:
>
> ```sh
> wine reg add 'HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion' /v CurrentBuild /t REG_SZ /d «BUILD_NUMBER» /f
> wine reg add 'HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion' /v CurrentBuildNumber /t REG_SZ /d «BUILD_NUMBER» /f
> /usr/local/bin/wineserver -k
> ```
> {: .nolineno }
>
> The last command will shut down the virtual Windows environment to ensure that all components agree on the Windows version the next time you launch your game.

##### Game won’t run because it requires Mono, .NET, or the MSVCRT runtime
> The evaluation environment for Windows games does not pre-install these runtime support packages. If your game makes use of one of these packages, consider searching for and downloading appropriate installers (`.exe` or `.msi`) and installing them to your evaluation environment. Additional runtime installers can be run on your environment by just launching the installer and following its installation instructions:
>
> ```sh
> wine <some-installer.exe>
> ```
> {: .nolineno }
>
> `.MSI` packages can be installed by launching the Windows uninstaller application and choosing to install a downloaded `.msi` package:
>
> ```sh
> wine uninstaller
> ```
> {: .nolineno }

##### Game won’t boot anymore despite no changes
Try clearing the shader cache

```sh
cd $(getconf DARWIN_USER_CACHE_DIR)/d3dm
cd «GAME_NAME»
rm -r shaders.cache
```
{: .nolineno }

##### Enable experimental MetalFX integration
> This **ONLY** works for **macOS 16 AND Game Porting Toolkit 3.0**!
> 
> See [Boost performance with MetalFX Upscaling](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/10103) video from [Apple Developer](https://developer.apple.com) for more information.

1. Rename `wine/x86_64-unix/nvngx-on-metalfx.so`{: .filepath} to `wine/x86_64-unix/nvngx.so`{: .filepath} if this hasn’t already been done
2. Rename `wine/x86_64-windows/nvngx-on-metalfx.dll`{: .filepath} to `wine/x86_64-windows/nvngx.dll`{: .filepath} if this hasn’t already been done
3. Copy both `nvngx.dll`{: .filepath} and `nvapi64.dll`{: .filepath} to the `windows\system32` directory in your Wine prefix’s virtual C: drive (open `$HOME/Games/drive_c/windows/system32`)
4. Set `D3DM_ENABLE_METALFX=1` to convert DLSS functions to MetalFX (where possible)

#### Steam
##### `steamwebhelper` not responding
> Complete the following steps if you updated Steam to the latest version and/or get an error along the lines of **steamwebhelper, a critical Steam component, is not responding. The Steam UI will not be usable.**
>
> This error is common when using an outdated version of Wine with a new version of Steam.

##### Steam download freezes
This is if you're unable to download a game via Steam (GUI/app). Usually it'll go up to a certain percentage (often 80%) and then immediately drops (i.e. stops downloading, graph goes flat to 0), giving an error like "content servers unreachable", "corrupt download", "content unavailable", etc.

###### Solution 1: Steam Console
Source[^steamconsole]

> Make sure you have the native Steam app for macOS
{: .prompt-important }

> Use `~` instead of `$HOME` for any paths!
{: .prompt-warning }

Open your web browser (e.g. Firefox, Chrome, Safari, etc.) and enter [`steam://open/console`](steam://open/console) in the URL bar

Once Steam (for macOS) opens, click the <kbd>Console</kbd> tab

Enter the following in the bottom prompt to enable downloading Windows games via macOS Steam

```plaintext
@sSteamCmdForcePlatformType windows
```

Either through [SteamDB.info](https://steamdb.info) or via the store page's link, find and copy the app ID (e.g. `3527290`) of the game you want to download

Enter the following in the console, where `<APP_ID>` is the app ID (e.g. `3164500`) of the game you want to download

```plaintext
app_install <APP_ID>
```

> If you need a beta access, include the following flag, where `<CHANNEL_NAME>` is the channel name
> ```plaintext
> -beta <CHANNEL_NAME>
> ```
{: .prompt-tip }

Once the app is done downloading, which you can see in your Steam's Download Manager, right click it and go to **Manage** > **Browse Local Files** to open Finder's window with the game files inside; this should be in path  `$HOME/Library/Application Support/Steam/steamapps/common/<YOUR_GAMES_NAME>`, where `<YOUR_GAMES_NAME>` is the name of the game you want to download

Move all of the aforementioned game files to the same location (i.e. `$WINEPREFIX/drive_c/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/<YOUR_GAMES_NAME>`) inside your Windows Steam installation

Two folders up (i.e. path `$HOME/Library/Application Support/Steam/steamapps/`), move the file `appmanifest_<APP_ID>.acf`{: .filepath}, where `<APP_ID>` is your game's Steam app ID, to the same location (i.e. `$WINEPREFIX/drive_c/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/`) inside your Windows Steam installation. E.g. `appmanifest_3164500.acf`{: .filepath}

Run your Windows Steam installation as normal and the game should appear as downloaded in your Steam library

###### Solution 2: SteamCMD
> If you already have [SteamCMD](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/SteamCMD) installed, go straight to Step #3.
{: .prompt-info }

Open terminal and create `SteamCMD` directory

```sh
mkdir $HOME/SteamCMD && cd $HOME/SteamCMD
```
{: .nolineno }

Download and extract SteamCMD

```sh
curl -sqL "https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/client/installer/steamcmd_osx.tar.gz" | tar zxvf -
```
{: .nolineno }

Run SteamCMD

```sh
./steamcmd.sh
```
{: .nolineno }

Set your app directory, where `<APP_PATH>` is where you want to save the game. In this case, it'll be in your Wine prefix's (`$WINEPREFIX`) `steamapps` directory (i.e. `$WINEPREFIX/drive_c/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/`)

```sh
force_install_dir <APP_PATH>
```
{: .nolineno }

> If you are running SteamCMD from your path env or installed it as a package, it will return an error if you try to use `.` as a directory. A workaround for this is to use the absolute path to the current directory.
{: .prompt-warning }

When downloading/downloaded via SteamCMD:
Downloaded `appmanifest` is in `<APP_PATH>/steamapps/` directory.
Downloaded `appmanifest` should be [moved] in `$WINEPREFIX/drive_c/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/` directory.
`<APP_PATH>/steamapps/` can be deleted AFTER its `appmanifest` has been moved to `$WINEPREFIX/drive_c/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/` directory.
`<APP_PATH>/!steamapps/` contains everything [that should be] in the game's source folder (i.e. `$WINEPREFIX/drive_c/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/<GAME_NAME>/`)

Login to your Steam account, where `<STEAM_USERNAME>` is your Steam username (or `anonymous` if you don't want to login, though you won't be able to download your purchased games)

```sh
login <STEAM_USERNAME>
```
{: .nolineno }

> Valve recommends setting the install directory **BEFORE** logging in
{: .prompt-tip }

Install or update the app using the `app_update` command, where `<APP_ID>` is the app's [Steam Application ID](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Steam_Application_IDs "Steam Application IDs"). If you don't know the Steam Application ID for the server, tool, or game you want to download, use [steamdb.info](https://steamdb.info) to locate it.

```sh
app_update <APP_ID> [-beta <BETA_NAME>] [-betapassword <BETA_PASSWORD>] [validate]
```
{: .nolineno }

> - [Dedicated server list](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Dedicated_Servers_List "Dedicated Servers List")
> - Use the `-beta <BETA_NAME>` option to download a beta branch
> - For beta branches protected by a password, include the `-betapassword <BETA_PASSWORD>` option to be able to download from them
> - Add `validate` to the command to check all the server files to make sure they match SteamCMD files; this command is useful if you think files may be missing or corrupted. However, this will overwrite any changed files to the server default; any files that aren't part of the default installation will not be affected. Therefore, it is recommended you use this command only on initial installation and if there are server issues.

Log off Steam servers once finished

```sh
quit
```
{: .nolineno }

If you want to use a script

```plaintext
@ShutdownOnFailedCommand 1
@NoPromptForPassword 1

// Use this instead if you don't want to login
// login anonymous

app_update <APP_ID> validate
quit
```
{: file="install_game.txt" }

Run script with the `+runscript` option, where `<SCRIPT_NAME>` is your script's filename (e.g. `install_game.txt`)

```sh
./steamcmd.sh +runscript <SCRIPT_NAME>
```
{: .nolineno }

> - If you get an error like `Failed to load script file '<SCRIPT_NAME>'`, try providing an absolute path, e.g. `/absolute/path/to/<SCRIPT_NAME>`
> - If you get an error like `Failed to install app '<APP_ID>' (No subscription)`, the game/server you are trying to download either requires a login or that you have purchased the game. You will therefore have to log in with a Steam username and password (i.e. use `login <STEAM_USERNAME> <STEAM_PASSWORD>` instead of `login anonymous`).
{: .prompt-info }

The aforementioned script is functionally the same as:

```sh
./steamcmd.sh +@sSteamCmdForcePlatformType windows +force_install_dir <APP_PATH> +login <STEAM_USERNAME> +app_update <APP_ID> validate +quit
```

#### Memory
##### Dynamically allocate VRAM
Allocate memory for VRAM, where `DESIRED_VRAM_MB` is an integer number of how many MB of VRAM you want to allocate.[^vram]

```sh
sudo sysctl iogpu.wired_limit_mb=DESIRED_VRAM_MB
```
{: .nolineno }

To set it permanently:

```sh
sudo touch /etc/sysctl.conf
sudo chown root:wheel /etc/sysctl.conf
sudo chmod 0644 /etc/sysctl.conf
echo "iogpu.wired_limit_mb=DESIRED_VRAM_MB" >> /etc/sysctl.conf
```

##### Set video memory size
Sometimes Game Porting Toolkit and your game not properly communicating with each other about how much Video RAM your system has (more than likely, GPTk is not getting the correct value from your system).[^vidmem]

You may need this setting if you have the following symptoms:
- Strange rendering
- Crash/Freeze on launch
- A log file that says something like:  
```plaintext
fixme:d3d_texture:texture_init Failed to create surface 0x35c4fc68, hr 0x8876017c
err:d3d:resource_init Out of adapter memory
```

Click the Apple icon in the upper-left corner and select **About This Mac**

![mbp_ram.png](../assets/obsidian/mbp_ram.png)

Note the value next to `Memory` (e.g. `64 GB`), multiply it by either `2` or `3`, then divide by either `3`  or `4`

`64 * 2 / 3 = 128 / 3 ≈ 42`

Round the result down if it's not a whole number.

Your final answer is the approximate amount of VRAM you have. This is an approximation since MacBook Pro M-series uses unified memory (i.e. memory is shared between CPU and GPU), so there's only RAM, not VRAM. Technically the amount of VRAM you have is equal to the amount of RAM, but in practice it's less since some of that RAM is reserved by the system to prevent instability.

##### Some games have messed up and/or crackling audio
**part 1: audio crackling (far cry 3) -- sounds like it's coming out a Geiger counter**
Press CMD+Space to open Spotlight Search and type in „MIDI“, you should see the app Audio MIDI Setup.

In this app you select your speaker on the left and change the Output with a click on the drop down menu at the right side. Change it to 96,000Hz (default should be set to 44,000hz I think)
https://www.reddit.com/r/macgaming/comments/1jcw1w7/comment/mi81abl

##### Some games don't have sound
Some games stopped having any sound at some point while others had no issue. Games that I tried that had this problem include Cities Skylines, Starcraft 2 and Heroes of the Storm.

The solution: It seems that the problem was caused from the extra audio drivers installed as plugin by Microsoft Teams. After removing the MSTeams audio driver folder and restarted the problem disappeared.

macOS often restricts Terminal access to certain system-related directories, which can cause the "Operation not permitted" error when trying to delete certain files (like this driver). To grant Terminal full disk access:
    Go to System Preferences > Privacy & Security > Full Disk Access
    Enable iTerm/Terminal (if it's not already listed, click the plus (+) button to add an application and choose Terminal / iTerm).

```sh
sudo rm -rf /Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/HAL/MSTeamsAudioDevice.driver
```
{: .nolineno }

I've seen similar reports for other games that also had sound problems and after users removed any extra audio drivers, sound started working again. Looking into this problem I saw similar reports about Zoom audio drivers as well.

By the way removing the Teams audio drivers does not prevent Teams from working normally, So I have no idea what these drivers do. They are an optional module during Teams setup.

#### Fonts
##### Unreadable or missing fonts
You may not have any fonts installed. To easily link all of the system fonts so they are accessible from wine:

```sh
cd "$WINEPREFIX/drive_c/windows/Fonts" && for i in /usr/share/fonts/**/*.{ttf,otf}; do ln -s "$i"; done
```
{: .nolineno }

Wine uses FreeType to render fonts, and FreeType's defaults changed a few releases ago. Try using the following environment variable when running programs in Wine:

```sh
FREETYPE_PROPERTIES="truetype:interpreter-version=35"
```
{: .nolineno }

Another possibility is to [install Microsoft's TrueType fonts](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Microsoft_fonts#Installation "Microsoft fonts") into your wine prefix. If this does not help, try running `winetricks corefonts` first, then `winetricks allfonts` as a last resort.

After running such programs, kill all Wine servers and run `winecfg`. Fonts should be legible now.

##### Smeared fonts
If the fonts look somehow smeared, run the following command to change a setting in the Wine registry.

```sh
wine reg add 'HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Wine\X11 Driver' /v 'ClientSideWithRender' /t REG_SZ /d 'N'
```
{: .nolineno }

#### Keyboard
##### Fix keyboard shortcuts
Wine by default maps the keys differently than native macOS applications. It's possible to change some of the keyboard mappings.

Map <kbd>Option</kbd> as <kbd>Alt</kbd>:

```sh
wine reg add 'HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Wine\Mac Driver' /v 'LeftOptionIsAlt' /t REG_SZ /d 'Y'
wine reg add 'HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Wine\Mac Driver' /v 'RightOptionIsAlt' /t REG_SZ /d 'Y'
```
{: .nolineno }

Map <kbd>Command</kbd> as <kbd>CTRL</kbd>:

```sh
wine reg add 'HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Wine\Mac Driver' /v 'LeftCommandIsCtrl' /t REG_SZ /d 'Y'
wine reg add 'HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Wine\Mac Driver' /v 'RightCommandIsCtrl' /t REG_SZ /d 'Y'
```
{: .nolineno }

##### Keyboard input not working
This could be caused by the window manager not switching focus.

###### Solution 1: Winetricks
```sh
winetricks usetakefocus=n
```
{: .nolineno }

###### Solution 2: Regedit
Toggle all the **Window settings**, click **Apply**, then change them back.

If that does not work, go to the **Graphics** tab of `winecfg`, disable the **Allow the window manager...** options, or set windowed mode with **Emulate a virtual desktop**.

If the keyboard still does not work after unfocusing the application, try editing the registry

```sh
wine reg add 'HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Wine\X11 Driver' /t REG_SZ /v 'UseTakeFocus' /d 'N' /f
```
{: .nolineno }

#### Miscellaneous
##### "Symbol not found" when setting game mode
You may get this error if setting `game-mode` (e.g. `/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin/gamepolicyctl game-mode set auto`)

```plaintext
dyld[52755]: Symbol not found: _$s2os6LoggerV10GamePolicyE4toolACvau
  Referenced from: <EF9CA6F2-E5BD-35B1-ACC3-E45E7CBB0AD4> /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin/gamepolicyctl

Abort trap: 6
```

This may be due to a version mismatch (especially if you recently updated your OS without updating XCode). To fix, update XCode and then try running `game-mode` again.

> `gamepolicyctl` tool may have been compiled against an older version of `GamePolicy.framework` than the one installed on your system. This often happens when you have mismatched Xcode and macOS versions.

##### DXVK runs out of memory and crashes
With the following repeated in the terminal

```plaintext
[mvk-warn] VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_POOL_MEMORY: VkDescriptorPool exhausted pool of (x) descriptors. Allocating descriptor dynamically.
```

You should allocate enough memory [in the pool] by creating multiple pools.

`VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_POOL_MEMORY`:
- Used to determine when to allocate a new descriptor pool.
- Returned if allocation fails due to no more space in the descriptor pool (and not because of system or device memory exhaustion).

##### Applications fail to start
Some older games and applications assume that the current working directory is the same as that which the executable is in. Launching these executables from other locations will prevent them from starting correctly. Use `cd path_containing_exe` before invoking Wine to rule this possibility out.

### Tips + Tricks
#### Launch games as an app
##### Method 0: App Bundle
TODO: How to make custom Wine as app bundle so that I can set game mode. (since `game-mode` cmd is currently broken so I can't set it that way.) this is bc macbook pro automatically enables game mode if it detects a game running. i think it determines it from `plist` in app bundle or sumn related. since i'm running via wine, i have to make one from scratch so mac recognizes it as a game and auto enables game mode for me. use bookmarked tut.

##### Method 1: Automator
You can use the Automator app to create a new Application that will run Steam when you click on its icon (similar to how Applications work)

![automator.png](../assets/obsidian/automator.png)

Open Automator

Select  **Application** and click **Choose**

In the sidebar on the left, click  **Utilities**, then double-click  **Run Shell Script**

Select` /bin/bash` as the shell and pass input **to stdin**, then paste the following in the textbox:

```sh
#!/bin/bash

arch -x86_64 /bin/bash

export PATH="/usr/local/bin:${PATH}"
export D3DM_SUPPORT_DXR=1
export ROSETTA_ADVERTISE_AVX=1
export WINEDLLOVERRIDES="dinput8=n,b;d3d11,d3d10,d3d12,dxgi=b"
export WINEESYNC=1
export WINEDEBUG=-all
export WINEPREFIX="$HOME/Games"

wine "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steam.exe" > /dev/null 2>&1 &
```

Once you save this automated application (file format  **Application**, I have it saved as `Steam (Windows)`, though you can name it anything), you'll want to set a custom icon to make it discernable

Copy (i.e. right-click, then press **Copy Image**) the image you want to use as your icon (preferably `.icns` file format)

This is the app icon I use for Steam (Windows); click on the image to download it

![steam_icon.webp](../assets/obsidian/steam_icon.webp) ([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/blender/comments/shk9dr/some_app_icons_ive_made_over_the_last_couple_of))

I've also converted it to Apple's `.icns` file format (it isn't displaying due to the file format), so you won't have to manually convert from `.webp` to `.icns`
![steam_icon.icns](../assets/obsidian/steam_icon.icns.md)

Find the application you saved earlier, right-click it, then click **Get Info**

Click the default icon at the top (it'll be outlined when you do), right above the **Add Tags...** textbox

Press <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>V</kbd> (i.e. <kbd>CMD</kbd> + <kbd>V</kbd>) to paste the image you just copied, and you'll see the icon update accordingly

You can now run the Windows version of Steam anytime you click the app icon! This is much more user-friendly than running commands in the terminal each time.

##### Method 2: Shortcuts
// TODO

##### Method 3: AppleScript
> Taken from [David Baumgold's tutorial on installing Wine on Mac](https://www.davidbaumgold.com/tutorials/wine-mac). I haven't used this tutorial myself (I prefer my Bash scripts and Automator application), but I'm including this in case it's helpful to anyone else.
{: .prompt-info }

Open `Script Editor` (in the `/Applications/Utilities` directory)

You should see a window with a large area you can type in near the top: this is where you write your AppleScript. In that area, type the following text:

```plaintext
tell application "Terminal"
    do script "WINEPREFIX=~/Games wine $PATH_TO_PROGRAM.exe"
end tell
```

Replace `$PATH_TO_PROGRAM` with the path from the Program Files directory to your program executable.

Press **Compile** button at the top of the window. The text should become colored to indicate that Script Editor understands what you wrote. You can also try pressing the Run button to run your script: it should open the Windows program successfully.

Save your script; Select **File Format: Application** in the save options, and leave **Startup Screen** unchecked.

Open up the Finder, go to where you saved your script, and drag that file to your Dock. It should stay there, just like a real application!

Find and download a folder icon you like (preferably `.icns` file format)

{: .prompt-tip }

Once downloaded, select the folder icon and copy it
	- <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> (i.e. <kbd>CMD</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>)
	- Right-click the icon and click **Copy**

Back in `/Applications`, right-click `Steam` folder and click **Get Info**

![steam_get_info.png](../assets/obsidian/steam_get_info.png)

Click on the icon in the upper-left corner (it should be outlined in your system's accent color; in my case it's purple)

![steam_folder_info.png](../assets/obsidian/steam_folder_info.png)

Paste the folder icon with <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>V</kbd> (i.e. <kbd>CMD</kbd> + <kbd>V</kbd>) to update `Steam` folder's icon accordingly

Now that you have a custom `Steam` folder with both Mac and Windows versions of Steam (i.e. `Steam.app` and `Steam (Windows).app`), drag the folder into the dock

To adjust the appearance, right-click the `Steam` folder icon in the dock (that you just dragged)

Make the following selections
	- Under **Display as**, select **Folder**
	- Under **View content as**, select **Grid**

![folder_options.png](../assets/obsidian/folder_options.png)

You now have a convenient way to access both versions of Steam via your dock! If you open the `Steam` folder and click on either of the `.app`s, it should launch as expected

##### Method 2: System Registry
The command below reads the system registry of `$WINEPREFIX` and returns `#arch=win32` or `#arch=win64` depending on the architecture type.

```sh
reg_arch="$(grep '#arch' $WINEPREFIX/system.reg)" && echo "${reg_arch#'#arch='}" || echo "Unknown"
```

#### Restrict Wine processes to subset of available cores
Here's a hack that allows you to restrict Wine processes to a subset of the available cores.[^restrictwine]

You can pass a CPU mask through the `WINECPUMASK` environment variable:

`WINECPUMASK=0xff wine ... `

This will tie Wine processes (including `wineserver`) to the first 8 cores. It will also limit the number of reported cores to 8.

To get a performance gain on Ryzen the mask should specify the cores of one core complex (CCX). Here's little bash script that computes the mask for the first CCX:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
local model_name="$(sysctl -n machdep.cpu.brand_string)"

NUM_CPUS=$(sysctl -n hw.logicalcpu)
echo "$NUM_CPUS-core CPU"

CCX_MASK=$(((1 << $NUM_CPUS / 2) - 1))
echo -n "first CCX mask: "
printf "0x%x\n" $CCX_MASK
```

With this patch The Forest goes from 23 to 40 fps on a 16 core Ryzen CPU. It would be interesting to see if this also makes difference for the games mentioned here and in duplicate reports.

#### Update MoltenVK
> [MoltenVK](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/MoltenVK) is a layered implementation of [Vulkan](https://www.khronos.org/vulkan) graphics and compute functionality, built on Apple's [Metal](https://developer.apple.com/metal) graphics and compute framework...
> 
> Refer to 
[MoltenVK's `README.md`](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/MoltenVK?tab=readme-ov-file#command_line_build) for steps on how to install MoltenVK from source

MoltenVK is a software library which allows Vulkan applications to run on top of Metal on Apple's macOS, iOS, and tvOS operating systems.

Assuming you already have CrossOver, it is possible to add its support for Windows Vulkan games (atop MoltenVK) to GPTk[^gptkvulk]. I also used this method to update MoltenVK for DXVK Wine build.

Set these environment variables

### Logging
This subsection is taken directly from Game Porting Toolkit's `README.md` file and has been modified in some parts.

> The provided `bin/ee4wg*` scripts can be copied onto your path to facilitate different forms of logging and launching. You can run these scripts from any shell; you don’t need to switch to the Rosetta environment first.
{: .prompt-tip }

> - Logging output will appear in the Terminal window in which you launch your game as well as the system log, which can be viewed with `/System/Applications/Utilities/Console.app`{: .filepath}
> - Log messages from the evolution environment for Windows games are prefixed with **D3DM** and are logged to the system log using the "D3DMetal" category. By default the `ee4wg*` scripts will filter to just the **D3DM**-prefixed messages.
> - If you are experiencing an issue and want to send logging information through [https://feedbackassistant.apple.com](https://feedbackassistant.apple.com), please attach and send the full logs without filtering to **D3DM**

### Debugging
Using Metal Debugger. This subsection is taken directly from Game Porting Toolkit's `README.md` file and has been modified in some parts.

> You will need to [disable System Integrity Protection (SIP)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/disabling_and_enabling_system_integrity_protection) to debug CrossOver's Wine processes.
> Reenable SIP after you finish debugging.
{: .prompt-info }

Compile your shaders with embedded debug information ([https://developer.apple.com/metal/shader-converter/#shader](https://developer.apple.com/metal/shader-converter/#shader)) by passing `-Zi -Qembed_debug` to the DX Compiler.

In CrossOver, select a bottle to launch your game from.

Enable **D3DMetal** in the **Advanced Settings** for the bottle.

Launch your game by clicking **Run Command**, choosing your game executable, and inserting the following environment variables to enable Metal debugging and processing of debug information:

```sh
MTL_CAPTURE_ENABLED=1
D3DM_DXIL_PROCESS_DEBUG_INFORMATION=1
```
{: .nolineno }

In Xcode, click **Debug** > **Debug Executable…** from the menubar and select `CrossOver.app` (this is just to get a workspace window open)

In the visible Scheme options, click the **Options** tab and change **GPU Frame Capture** from **Automatically** to **Metal**.

Close Scheme.

Click **Debug** > **Attach to Process** from the menubar and select your launched game process.

After the debugger attaches to the process, you can [capture your Metal workload](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/capturing-a-metal-workload-in-xcode#Capture-your-Metal-workload-while-debugging).

> If `lldb` suspends the process due to handling `SIGUSR1`, you will need to run the following commands to ignore this signal and continue the process:
> ```sh
> process handle -pass false -stop false -notify false
> SIGUSR1
> continue
> ```
> {: .nolineno }
{: .prompt-info }

Clear terminal:
- <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>L</kbd>
- `clear`
