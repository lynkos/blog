Hi, I'm Kiran. My areas of focus are Computer Science, Mathematics, and Statistics. I'm a 4x Software Engineer Intern at Oracle Cloud during Summers 2021 – 2024 and have worked as a research assistant on post-quantum cybersecurity research.

I've been coding since I was 12, starting off with HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript in order to customize my Tumblr blog at the time. I soon became obsessed with the web design aspect of programming, creating Tumblr themes for others as a theme-maker. However, it wasn't until I took AP Computer Science in 10th grade that I learned my first real programming language: Java. After that, everything fell into place. I joined my high school's computer science club and participated in programming competitions (i.e. competitive programming) along with cybersecurity competitions (i.e. CTFs aka capture the flags). After school I'd come home and practice [competitive] programming problems from <a target="_blank" href="https://onlinejudge.org" title="UVa Online Judge"><u>UVa Online Judge</u></a>. I genuinely had no particular reason or incentive for doing so; it was all for the love of the game.

I enjoy traveling, <a href="https://github.com/lynkos/lynkos/blob/master/PHOTOGRAPHY%20PORTFOLIO.pdf" target="_blank"><u>photography</u></a> (Nikon D5100 DSLR), <a target="_blank" href="https://www.applegamingwiki.com/wiki/User:Lynkos"><u>gaming</u></a>, listening to music, reading, journaling/writing (check out <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.lynkos.dev"><u>my blog</u></a>!), doodling, daydreaming, creating, fashion, design, skincare, watching <a href="https://myanimelist.net/profile/lynkos" target="_blank"><u>anime</u></a>, vibing with friends, programming/cybersecurity competitions (e.g. CTFs, hackathons, etc), and memes during my downtime. <a href="https://lynkos420.blogspot.com" target="_blank"><u>This blog</u></a> contains some of my solutions to certain CTF puzzles/problems; it's a relic from the past as I created and contributed to it during my last 2 years of high school. During that time, I also enjoyed spending a lot of time working on statistics problems for math competitions (specifically Mu Alpha Theta, aka math honor society for high school).

On top of all that, I enjoy reading research papers and watching YouTube channels (e.g. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/keeroyz" target="_blank"><u>Two Minute Papers</u></a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/3blue1brown" target="_blank"><u>3Blue1Brown</u></a>, etc). If I had to name a research paper that's currently piqued my interest, it'd have to be <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8967098" target="_blank"><u>Towards Post-Quantum Blockchain: A Review on Blockchain Cryptography Resistant to Quantum Computing Attacks</u></a> by Tiago M. Fernández-Caramès and Paula Fraga-Lamas.

Here are some of my research interests:
